In spring boot app, we only need to add the spring boot security dependency.
Spring boot auto configures the security with sensible defaults within the
WebSecurityConfiguration.class.

Authentication --> Process of verifying the identity of an individual.It ensures the
user is who they claim to be. It involvbes validation of credentials like username and
passwords and creates a security context for the user.

Authorization --> It determines wheteher an authenticated individual has the necessary
permissions to access a particular resource and perform an action. It controls
what an authenticated user can do ar not do.

Internal working :
1. In Spring boot application , SecurityFilterAutoConfiguration automatically registers,
the DelegatingFilterProxy filter with the name springsecurityfilterchain.

2.Once the request reaches the DelegatingFilterProxy .Spring delegates the
processing to filterchainproxy bean that utilizes the SecurityFilterChain to execute the list of all tghe
fuilters to be invoked for the current request.
